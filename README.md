# conjecture
A python library of mathematical conjectures.

## Motivation
Mathematical conjectures are deemed "unproven" by conventional means. Many are proven
by example and rigorous bounds testing. Many have numerous practical applications. 
The purpose of conjecture.py is to be a self contained single file (when possible)
python library which attempts to provide an implementation of all mathematical 
conjectures for use in python programs.

## Coding standards
 - Please use 4 spaces for each indentation

 - Please attmept to implement the entire function 
   directly in conjecture.py when possible. Referecing
   an external dependancy or another githup project also OK.
   
 - Please also update this README.md with an example of
   how to use the added conjecture interface.
   
 - Please feel free to add any missing conjectures in 
   alphabetical order when possible.
